## Overview
This my second project with ASP Core MVC after [Student Distribution](https://github.com/sped439/StudentDistribution "Student Distribution") ,It is a web site that could use as a simple social network for writing and sharing articles by give the the ability to every one to create his own blog in just minutes and start writing and sharing his articles to the world.

## Why I start this project.
The main reason to start this project is to put harder challenge for me after I finsih my first project , The idea start to be just personal blog and then turned to be a website that anyone can use the and turned to be some thing like small social network maybe with some limits but still not bad (for me at least)

###What I learn from that project
 After I saw [where the problem for me ](https://github.com/sped439/StudentDistribution#what-should-do-know "where the problem for me ") I read a lot to make this project better in a lot of ways and that was obvious in my database design ,and hosted my website for first time for me.
